This is a photo editing program.
It has basic implementation, however, I am in the process of making this program run with FULL implementation.


The program reads in an XML file from an image, parses the data into a linked list, registers user input for changes, updates the data, and outputs the file.


As of right now, the selection of the images in hardcoded into the program as I could not implement directory selection for the files.

Included in the project files are 2 images along with their XML files. There is also a backup folder in the event something happens to the originals.

Once you run the program, you will see the default values for each attributes. 
You can view, edit, or reset (to 0) any of the attributes you choose, and then save and exit the program.

Once done, if you compare the values between the two XML files, you will notice that the values have been updated, and if re-uploaded to Lightroom, the updates will be applied to the images. 


If you open both the old and new XML and compare the following lines, you will notice that the values have been changed.

Line 62: Temperature
Line 63: Tint
Line 64: Saturation
Line 68: VignetteAmount
Line 76: Vibrance
Line 131: Exposure2012
Line 132: Contrast2012
